# Real-host regression: the demo deck

The **Insert demo deck** action (Automation tab) is PowerChart's real-host
regression harness. It drops one slide per chart kind + feature + element onto
fresh slides, so a human — or a diff — can see what PowerPoint *actually* draws.
This catches host-only bugs the vitest fakes cannot (ellipse repaint, wedge
tessellation, slide-timing races), which is the whole point: the fake asserts our
intent, the deck asserts the host's behaviour.

The deck is **self-identifying and self-summarising**: it opens with a **title
slide** stamping the running build *and* the host (`Office.context.diagnostics` →
`PowerPoint · OfficeOnline · 16.0.x`), a **contents** slide indexing every chart
with its office-shape count, and closes with a **results slide** — a summary line
plus a table of only the skipped/failed items. So an exported PDF is a complete,
comparable record of one run without opening the console: which build, which host,
what failed, how long it took.

A stalled slide is NOT retried. It was, once, and that retry is where every
duplicate slide in this project came from: the readback that judged the first
attempt "short" ran while the host was still committing, so it was routinely
wrong, and the retry drew the same chart again on a new slide. Both then
landed. The settled repair pass at the end does the same job with evidence
instead of a guess — see section 3.

## 0. The independent check — audit the deck itself

```bash
npm run verify-deck -- path/to/Presentation.pptx      # or --json
```

Reads the saved `.pptx` and reports, per slide: slot, run token, whether the
chart is a group or a degraded picture, whether it carries a
`POWERCHART_CONFIG`, and whether it wears a `NOT COMPLETE` banner. Exit 0 when
the file is structurally sound, 1 on a fault, 2 when it cannot be read.

**Run this before believing the run report.** Every hard diagnosis in this
project was settled by the bytes rather than by the add-in's own summary —
including one where the summary was the thing that was wrong: a 39-slide web
run reported 20 tagged charts where the file provably carried 31. The log
agreed with itself and was false. Nothing in the add-in can catch that, because
the add-in is the thing under test.

What counts as a **fault** is deliberately narrow: an unreferenced tag part, a
tag part missing its `[Content_Types]` override, a config that is not valid
JSON, a config with no `PowerChart` object to load it from, or two slides
claiming the same run *and* slot. Those are things this repo wrote wrong. A
deck missing eight charts because the host dropped them is a bad RUN and a
perfectly well-formed FILE, and is reported without being called a fault — as
are two different runs' slides in one deck, which is the case the run token
exists to survive.

## 0b. The join — deck against run log

```bash
npm run triage -- Presentation.pptx powerchart-run-log.json   # --all, --json
```

The two files may be given in either order — the extension says which is which.
Piping `--json` anywhere needs `npm run --silent` (or `node scripts/triage.mjs`
directly), because npm prints its own banner to stdout ahead of the script.

The two files a real run produces are the entire evidence base, and reading
them *together* is where the findings are: slot by slot, what the run believed
it did against what the file actually holds.

The verdicts, and what each means:

| verdict         | the run said              | the file holds          |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `ok`            | drew it, tagged it        | it is there, tagged     |
| `lost`          | drew it                   | no slide for that slot  |
| `duplicated`    | drew it once              | two slides claim it     |
| `tag-lost`      | wrote the config tag      | no config tag           |
| `not-editable`  | never got the tag written | a chart with no config  |
| `repaired`      | gave up on the tag        | tagged — the repair won |
| `blank`         | drew it                   | a slide with no shapes  |
| `orphan`        | never issued that slot    | a slide carrying it     |
| `skipped`       | skipped it                | nothing — as expected   |

`repaired` and another run's slides are **not** disagreements; they are the
repair pass and the run token doing their jobs. Exit 0 when the two accounts
agree, 1 when they do not, 2 when a file cannot be read.

Both this and `verify-deck` are deliberately `.mjs` tools outside `src/`, so
they cannot inherit a bug from the code they audit.

**Why it exists.** This join used to be done by hand — unzip the deck,
pretty-print 160 KB of log, line the slots up, squint — and twice it was done
wrong: once from a truncated read of the log, once from a trace buffer that
spanned three runs and showed a contradiction that was not there. Each wrong
turn cost a full round trip: a deploy, a run in a real PowerPoint, an upload
and a re-read. The join is mechanical, so it belongs in a script.

## 1. The cheap pass — self-check (every run)

Insert the deck. When it finishes, the pane reports and the **console** (F12)
prints a per-chart table plus the run's integrity numbers:

```
chart        shapes  status    grouped   ms
Bubble         44    rendered     true   180
Combo          22    failed      false 45012   ← host stalled mid-draw (near the 45s timeout)
Doughnut       15    rendered     true   240
Area            0    skipped     false     2   ← too dense, stamped
deck grew by 33, issued 35 adds — 2 LOST; blank slots 24, 34 · total 78.4s
```

Read `insertDemoDeck`'s `DemoReport` (`src/render/powerpoint.ts`): `results[i]` is
`{created, status, ms, grouped}`; `slidesAdded` is the deck's ACTUAL growth (settled
`getCount`, after − before); `totalMs` is the whole run's wall-clock.

**Lost slides — measure against `addsIssued`, not `items.length`.** A failed item
can leave a **stray** slide, so `slidesAdded` can equal `items.length` even when
the host lost a real slide — the stray cancels it. So loss is
`addsIssued − slidesAdded`. A stray that LANDED cancels; a swallowed/lost add
does not — so this reads through the coincidence.
(A real run once lost 2 slides and reported 0 under the old `items.length` formula.)

**`blankSlides`** is the list of **1-based deck positions** of added slides that read
back with **zero shapes** — the host kept the slide but its content detached. It is
reported **by position, never by item name**: a blank slide has no content and no
config tag, so it cannot be attributed to an item, and under load the host reorders/
merges/loses slides, which breaks any positional item mapping anyway. Each `0` is
re-read once (a struggling host reports transient `0`s) before it counts, and
`blanksRead` is `false` if the readback faulted — so an empty list is never mistaken
for "no blanks" when it means "not fully measured".

Honest limits of `blankSlides`: it cannot see a **merge** (two items on one slide —
that slide isn't blank), loss *inside* a group, or a **paint-only** blank
(office-js#2699 — the shapes exist, so `getCount > 0`). Naming the missing/merged
charts by their config tag (`CHART_TAG`, deck-wide, order-independent) is a
**documented follow-up**, not yet built.

This pass needs no PDF and catches structural regressions: skipped, failed, lost
(via `addsIssued`), and empty slots (via `blankSlides`).

It does NOT catch *paint* bugs — a shape created but not rendered (office-js#2699)
still counts. That's what the visual pass is for.

## 2. The visual pass — PDF diff (when paint correctness matters)

Export the deck to PDF, then compare each page to its SVG reference (the SVG
renderer is the source of truth — see the byte-identical snapshot invariant).

```
# render the PDF pages
python -c "import fitz; d=fitz.open('deck.pdf'); [p.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(2,2)).save(f'p{i+1:02}.png') for i,p in enumerate(d)]"
# map pages -> chart by title
python -c "import fitz; [print(i+1, p.get_text().split(chr(10))[0]) for i,p in enumerate(fitz.open('deck.pdf'))]"
# render references: sceneToSvg(buildChart(sampleConfig(kind))) -> Chrome --screenshot
```

**Pair by TITLE, not page number** — a lost or misaligned slide shifts the page
order (map the title text on each page to the chart).

**Two artifacts that WILL bite you** (both flagged bogus "defects" on a real run):

- *Framing.* The rendered chart sits in a *sub-region* of a 960×540 slide (placed
  at ~60,90 with margins), while a raw SVG reference fills its own frame. So
  "rendered is smaller / shifted down-right" is not a defect — it flagged 15
  charts once. Either place the reference on a 960×540 canvas at the same offset,
  or tell the reviewer to ignore absolute scale/position and judge only data,
  proportions, colour, and completeness.
- *Title text.* `demoItems()` overrides each sample's title with a short label
  (`{...sampleConfig(kind), title: label}`), so a reference built from
  `sampleConfig(kind)` shows the sample's LONG title — a "title differs / colour
  lost" mismatch that isn't real. Build references with the SAME title override
  the demo uses.

Net from the run that produced this doc: of ~20 "findings", exactly ONE was a real
render bug (doughnut arc gaps); the rest were these two artifacts, known host
limits, or the stamp/stall. Distrust the diff; verify each finding against the
scene before filing.

## Known host limitations (not regressions)

- **Filled polygons render as outline only** (radar/violin fills missing) — Office.js
  has no freeform fill; the SVG reference fills them, the host can't.
- **Dense charts (>~90 shapes) are skipped + stamped** on web (area, tile map,
  waffle, smoothed line) — they exceed the per-slide shape budget.
- **Freshly-inserted shapes may not repaint** until zoom/navigate (office-js#2699).

Relevant OfficeDev/office-js issues: #2699 (repaint), #2903/#2474 (slide-add
timing / non-round-trip ids), #4272 (>50-item load hang). See `docs/repro/` for a
Script Lab repro of the ellipse case.
