/**
 * The fast local gate — CI's own commands, read from package.json, and an
 * honest list of what it does NOT run.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-23 a push went out reported as "gate green:
 * typecheck 0, lint 0, format clean, 3310 tests" and CI failed on
 * `prettier --check .`. The local check had been `prettier --check src test
 * scripts docs` — a hand-assembled subset that never looked at `crashes/`,
 * where the driver had just archived a dump from a round whose browser died.
 * The claim was "format clean"; the check was "format clean in four
 * directories". A gate whose scope does not match the claim made about it is
 * the defect this repo spends most of its comments on, and it had reached the
 * thing that verifies everything else.
 *
 * WHY IT READS package.json INSTEAD OF SHELLING OUT TO `npm run`. Two reasons,
 * and the second is the interesting one.
 *
 * The point of the gate is that its commands cannot drift from CI's. Hardcoding
 * `prettier --check .` here would reintroduce exactly the drift it exists to
 * stop, so the command TEXT is read from the same `scripts` block CI invokes by
 * name. Change `format:check` in package.json and this changes with it.
 *
 * And on this box it could not shell out anyway: AppLocker blocks an npm script
 * that nests `npm run` inside itself — "This program is blocked by group
 * policy" — which is what the first version of this file did, and it died on
 * its first real use. Running the script BODIES with `node_modules/.bin` on
 * PATH is what `npm run` does, minus the nesting.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY SKIPS, printed on success so it can never be mistaken
 * for the whole of CI: coverage thresholds, the vite build, the manifest check,
 * the skill build, deck verification and OOXML validation, and the Playwright
 * e2e. Skipping them is a choice about speed; hiding that they were skipped
 * would be a lie about scope, which is the thing this file exists to stop.
