/**
 * Does the install path in the README still work?
 *
 * Everything in this repo gates the file in the working tree. Nothing has ever
 * looked at the file a USER downloads, and the two have now diverged twice:
 *
 * - v0.1.0 shipped the DEV manifests while the README said to download
 *   `manifest-prod.xml`, which was not in the release at all. Broken for twelve
 *   days, while `release.yml` sat correct and un-run.
 * - v0.3.0 (2026-07-31) shipped `<Version>0.1.0</Version>`, which Microsoft's
 *   validator rejects. CI found it on 2026-08-06 and #289 fixed the repo the
 *   same day. No release has been cut since, so the published manifest is still
 *   the rejected one and the fix has reached nobody.
 *
 * The second is the case a byte-comparison finds and a rules check alone does
 * not: the release was fine when it was cut, and went stale when main moved. So
 * this asks three questions, and the third is the one nothing else asks.
 *
 *   1. Does every asset the README names exist in the latest release?
 *   2. Do the published manifests satisfy the rules in `manifest-rules.mjs`?
 *   3. Do they still MATCH the committed ones — i.e. does the latest release
 *      carry the current fixes?
 *
 *   node scripts/check-published-install.mjs [--repo owner/name]
 *
 * Exit 0 when the published install path is sound, 3 when it is not (the same
 * "there is something to report" code the other sweeps use), 2 when the check
 * itself could not run — a network failure must never read as a clean bill.
