/**
 * What this host has said, question by question, across every round you have.
 *
 * `UNSTABLE_ANSWERS` in `host-baseline.mjs` exists because this host answers the
 * same question differently on different runs of one build, and an entry there
 * is a warning not to build on whichever answer a sheet happens to carry. The
 * entries are written by hand from whatever rounds the author had open, which
 * means they go stale silently: one said "ALTERNATES … it is a coin" about a
 * question that had by then answered the same way ten rounds running.
 *
 * Deciding whether to swap the committed fixture needs the same arithmetic —
 * CLAUDE.md says replace it when a new sheet answers AT LEAST AS MUCH, and
 * "count the ANSWERS" is a thing somebody has to actually count.
 *
 * So: point this at the rounds.
 *
 *   node scripts/host-history.mjs <round1.json> <round2.json> …
 *   node scripts/host-history.mjs --fixture <round*.json>   # also score each
 *                                                           # against the
 *                                                           # committed sheet
 *
 * Rounds are not in the repo — they are uploads. Keep them somewhere and pass a
 * glob. Exit 0 always: this reports, it does not gate.
 *
 * ORDERED BY THE ROUND'S OWN TIMESTAMP, never by the order the shell listed the
 * files. This tool's entire output is directional — "settled" counts from the
 * END, `latest` is the last column, and the fixture table's bottom line is read
 * as "the newest sheet" — and the docstring above tells you to pass a GLOB,
 * whose order is alphabetical by filename. Real round files are named by content
 * hash, so that order is effectively random.
 *
 * The cost was not hypothetical: the six rounds of 2026-08-11 in glob order made
 * `shapes-items-count-honest` read `steady lately — "unreadable" x 5` when the
 * NEWEST round had said `short-0`, and in true order the same six say
 * `UNSTABLE`. Opposite verdicts, same data. That is precisely the staleness this
 * tool was written to stop `UNSTABLE_ANSWERS` suffering by hand.
