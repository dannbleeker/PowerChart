/**
 * Re-read every office-js issue this repo cites, and say which have moved.
 *
 * This repo reasons from upstream bugs constantly — a comment says "the host
 * refuses X, see office-js#NNNN" and the code around it is shaped by that. Those
 * statements decay silently. Nobody is told when Microsoft closes one, and a
 * closed-as-completed issue means the opposite of what the comment says: the
 * behaviour may be FIXED, and the code may be working around nothing.
 *
 * The first time this was checked by hand, on 2026-08-14, four of the ten cited
 * issues had been closed as completed and two of the stale statuses were
 * load-bearing:
 *
 *   #5022  called "open and assigned" in host-probe.ts, and printed as "(open)"
 *          by triage on every did-not-respond problem. Closed 2024-11-18.
 *   #3014  the stated reason a `no` from `grouped-child-by-id-from-slide` was
 *          "expected". Closed 2025-03-03, so neither answer is expected now.
 *
 * Eighteen months of planning around a fixed bug, in a repo that documents
 * everything. Hence a script rather than a good intention.
 *
 *   node scripts/issue-status.mjs            # report
 *   node scripts/issue-status.mjs --check    # exit 1 if any cited issue is closed
 *
 * Needs `gh` on PATH and authenticated; without it this says so and exits 0
 * rather than failing a gate for a reason that is not about the code.
