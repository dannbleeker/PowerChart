/**
 * What actually changed between two renderings of the same chart.
 *
 * The add-in redraws a chart by deleting every shape and adding every shape
 * back. On PowerPoint for the web that is the single most expensive thing it
 * does: the 2026-08-11 rounds put a 24-shape chart at ~50 seconds — three
 * batches at ~17s each — and the cost grows with what is already on the slide,
 * so it gets worse as a deck fills up.
 *
 * Almost none of that work is needed. Measured against the clustered sample:
 *
 *     retitle                 1 of 24 nodes changed
 *     one data point edited   2 of 24
 *     rescale (scale.max)    18 of 24
 *
 * A retitle costs 24 deletes and 24 adds to move one text box's string.
 *
 * This module decides, from the two scenes alone, whether the difference can be
 * applied to the shapes already on the slide — and says no whenever anything is
 * less than obvious. It is pure so that the decision can be checked without a
 * PowerPoint, which is the same reason `positionalSweepPlan` and
 * `chooseGroupMembers` are their own functions: on this host the decision is
 * where the safety lives, and the host calls are just hands.

 * today" and "what was actually drawn on that slide" are the same thing only
 * while the engine has not changed. Ship a new default colour, a nudged label

 * unchanged, skip them, and leave the old rendering on the slide FOREVER —
 * where today's redraw-everything quietly repairs them on the next edit.
 *
 * So the fingerprint is written when the chart is drawn and checked when it is
 * updated. Matching means the rebuilt scene is the one on the slide; anything
 * else — a different engine, a hand-edited tag, a chart from another deck —

 *
 * - **The frame must be identical.** A chart that changed size is re-laid-out;

 *   rest in drawing order — so an index that means a different node in the two
 *   scenes writes a bar's geometry onto a label. Structural change of any sort

 * - **Every CHANGED node must be an updatable kind.** An unchanged wedge is

/**
 * Whether a plan is worth taking, given what the redraw would have cost.
 *
 * Kept separate from `planSceneUpdate` because it is a judgement about COST,
 * where the plan is a judgement about SAFETY.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL ARITHMETIC WAS WRONG, AND 0.5 IS STILL THE RIGHT NUMBER. Both
 * halves of that are measured, and they are measured separately.
 *
 * The old reasoning read: "a redraw is one delete plus one add per node, so an
 * update touching more than half is already doing more host calls per shape
 * saved." That counts an in-place write as ONE call per node. It is about
 * twenty, as the host's own statement list showed in round 145.
 *
 * AND THE FAST PATH IS MUCH FASTER, at a small share. Rounds 143-145 redrew;
 * 146-149 took the fast path, same scenarios, same deck, same host:
 *
 *     edit a chart on the visible slide   21218 22471 25352  ->   5176  5445  6108  5409
 *     edit the chart the user selected    27459 30275 29341  ->   9494  9207  9130  9294
 *     an update follows a moved chart     27364 31637 28914  ->   8886 10491  9120  9109
 *
 * Three to four times faster, three scenarios, no overlap. Every one of those
 * samples is `changed 1 of 24` — a 4% share.
 *
 * SO 0.8 WAS TRIED, AND IT CRASHED POWERPOINT — SIX TIMES OUT OF SIX. Round 150
 * (`6359d83`) raised the limit to admit the 18-of-24 and 9-of-16 edits that
 * `same scale across the deck` makes. Every one of its seven attempts died:
 *
 *     crashed at  255s  284s  282s  278s  257s  282s
 *
 * A 29-second window, six for six, on the first round after the change — and
 * `same scale across the deck` starts at 280s (round 149) and 302s (round 147).
 * The crash sits exactly where the one scenario the limit governs begins. No
 * round before it had crashed more than once, and none had failed to archive.
 *
 * The likely mechanism is the one this project already documents elsewhere: the
 * web host's per-slide budget, and proxy-memory exhaustion on a large batch.
 * Eight charts writing eighteen shapes apiece in place is a far bigger batch
 * than eight redraws, because a redraw spreads its work across deletes and adds
 * that the host paces itself.
 *
 * **So the cost model is refuted and a limit still stands.** The fast path wins
 * at 4% and kills the host at 75%; the crossover is somewhere between.
 *
 * 0.6 IS THAT NEXT STEP, and it is deliberately a small one. It admits the
 * 9-of-16 edits and still declines the 18-of-24 ones, so where 0.8 handed the
 * host eight charts writing eighteen shapes apiece — 144 extra shape-writes in
 * a round — this hands it two charts writing nine, which is 18. If the crash
 * was batch size, that is an eighth of the dose that caused it.
 *
 * Round 150 at 0.5 is the control and the host is healthy: 13/13 scenarios,
 * `same scale across the deck` at 195928 ms against a 196-237s band.
 *
 * ROUND 151 MEASURED IT AND 0.6 IS THE CEILING. It completed, 13/13, with
 * declines 8 to 6 and successes 3 to 5, and that scenario ran 164518 ms — 31
 * seconds below the MINIMUM of its five prior observations, on the same eight
 * charts and the same thirteen attempts.
 *
 * There is no rung above it. This battery produces exactly two shares, 9-of-16
 * and 18-of-24, so 0.7 would admit nothing new; and any limit that admits
 * 18-of-24 also admits 9-of-16, which is precisely the dose 0.8 died on six
 * times. 0.75 is not untested — it is tested, and it kills the host.
 *
 *     0.5    0 extra shape-writes    safe
 *     0.6    18 extra                safe, and 31s faster
 *     0.75+  162 extra               fatal, six times over
 *
 * THE SHARE IS A PROXY FOR THE WRONG THING. What the host refuses is shapes per
 * BATCH, and this update used to write every changed shape of every chart into
 * one batch and sync once. The demo deck hit the same wall and was fixed by
 * chunking — one `PowerPoint.run` per slide (#112) — not by a threshold.
 *
 * SO THE BATCH IS BOUNDED NOW, and this is 0.8 again on purpose.
 * `IN_PLACE_WRITES_PER_SYNC` caps a write at six shapes per sync, and round 152
 * measured that cap as free: 164626 ms against 164518 ms unchunked, 0.07% on a
 * 164-second scenario, with successes and declines unmoved.
 *
 * 0.8 is the value that crashed PowerPoint six times at 255-284s, and it is
 * deliberately the value used again, because it is the only one that
 * discriminates between the two explanations that round left standing:
 *
 * ROUND 153 ANSWERED IT: THE CRASH WAS PER-SYNC SIZE. It completed, 13/13, at
 * the same 0.8 that died six times unbounded.
 *
 *     150  0.5  unchunked   ok  3 | declined 10 | same scale 195928 ms
 *     151  0.6  unchunked   ok  5 | declined  8 | same scale 164518 ms
 *     152  0.6  CHUNKED     ok  5 | declined  8 | same scale 164626 ms
 *     153  0.8  CHUNKED     ok 11 | declined  2 | same scale 157403 ms
 *
 * `too much of the chart changed` went from six a round to NONE. The two
 * declines left are the correct ones: a picture, which is not in the scene, and
 * a chart with no parts list and no readable group members. Eleven of thirteen
 * is every attempt this battery can produce.
 *
 * SO THIS CONSTANT IS NO LONGER WHAT HOLDS THE HOST UP — `IN_PLACE_WRITES_PER_SYNC`
 * is. What survives here is a risk cap, not a cost model: where nearly every
 * node changes there is little left to save, and a redraw is the better-tested
 * way to a clean chart. Move it only on a round, and never without the batch
 * bound moving with it.
