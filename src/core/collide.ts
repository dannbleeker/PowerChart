 *
 * Without the flip these labels had nowhere to go. On a 480x300 combo at a 26pt

 * points up over ten tries, and came to rest inside the TITLE — every nudge
 * legal, the budget exhausted, and the collision merely relocated onto a worse
 * partner. Restricted to this list rather than opened to every movable label,
 * because a series label really can be reordered by moving down.
 *
 * The CAGR caption is here for the same reason and is worth its own note,
 * because the OTHER way of getting it off the title was tried and reverted:
 * flooring it at the title's bottom turned five `title x cagr-label` overlaps
 * into eight against the column totals. That was an unconditional move, and
 * this is not — the flip only takes a position already clear of everything
 * settled, and the totals rank ahead of it and are settled first. So it cannot
 * buy its way off the title by landing on a total; it stays put instead. Worth
 * 13 of the sweep's overlapping pairs against the earlier attempt's −3.

 * at y 57-75 on a 60pt-tall chart. That destination is off the bottom, so the
 * flip is correctly refused and the label stays where the layout put it —
 * drawn through the total. Shrinking does not help either, because the two are
 * centred at the same y whenever the column total and the line value coincide,
 * which is a property of the DATA.
 *
 * So one of them has to go, and `decor.tightLabelPriority` says which. This runs
 * AFTER de-collision on purpose: only labels that are still colliding once every
 * legal move has been tried are dropped, so a roomy chart keeps both and so does
 * a short chart whose data happens to separate them.
 *
