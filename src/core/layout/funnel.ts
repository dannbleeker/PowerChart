  // Room for the conversion label between bands — but the BANDS are the chart
  // and the gaps are chrome for a label, so the split is not "a point per band,
  // gaps take the rest". That is what this was, and on a 120x90 frame four gaps
  // took 59 of 64 points: five HAIRLINE bands at the 1pt floor, which is a
  // degenerate geometry rather than a small chart.
  //
  // The gaps get at most HALF the plot between them. Below that the fixed
  // `fs * 1.5` still wins, so nothing at an ordinary size moves — and either
  // way the cumulative pitch stays inside the plot, which is what the clamp was
  // originally for: a fixed gap on a short frame with many stages drove
  // `bandH + gap` per stage past the bottom and the last bands rendered
  // off-frame.
  //
  // AND THE BAND'S OWN FLOOR COMES OUT OF THE GAP, not out of the plot. `Math.max(1, …)`
  // is a floor that RAISES a height — the same shape as the quadrant label's
  // width floor and the scatter legend's before it — so with 24 stages on a 60pt
  // chart the 24 floored bands plus 23 gaps measured 36 points of a 24-point
  // plot and the last stage was drawn 10.4pt below the chart. Solving the gap
  // against the floored band keeps the pitch inside the plot: the chart's own
  // marks win the argument with the chrome between them, which is what the
  // paragraph above already says the split is for.
  //
  // Where even the hairlines do not fit — more stages than the plot has points —
  // the floor is abandoned rather than the stages. A sub-point band is a thin
  // line; a band drawn past the foot of the chart is on the slide.

  // The BANDS are solved for the plot above, so they always fit. Their LABELS
  // were not, and each escaped the frame a different way once the font outgrew
  // the chart:
  //
  //   - a label is centred in its band and its ink is about `f` tall, so once
  //     the font passed the band height the bottom row's label hung below the
  //     plot — 4.4pt at a 28pt font, 15.1 at 36;
  //   - a category name sits right-aligned in a gutter capped at 28% of the
  //     width, and a name wider than that cap runs off the LEFT edge of the
  //     chart: "Negotiation" by 35.9pt at 28, and 83.4pt at 36.
  //
  // Both are the same answer the agenda and the process flow already use, and
  // the one this file's value labels now use for the horizontal case: shrink
  // until it fits, then clip the remainder. Shrunk TOGETHER so a row's name and
  // its number stay the same size, and last-resort — at any font that already
  // fits, `labelFs` is `fs` and nothing moves.
  //
  // The loop used to stop at 6 whether or not the band could hold a 6pt label,
  // and a funnel's bands go to nothing long before its font does: at 14pt on an
  // 80x60 frame the bands are three points tall and every row's name was drawn
  // through the two either side of it, sixteen overlapping pairs across the
  // sweep. A floor that ignores its own reservation is the thing putting labels
  // where they cannot be read, so below `MIN_LABEL_FS` the whole set is dropped
  // — the same answer the radar, sunburst, tilemap and pie reservations give,
  // and the bands themselves still show the shape.
