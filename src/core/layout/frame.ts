     * value axis has no column at all — which is exactly what sank the
     * 2026-08-19 attempt to fit this to `frame.x`. Measured across the variant
     * sweep: **1,327 overlapping pairs to 1,014**, and no shape that was not
     * already there.
     *
     * AND THE `y` IS LEFT ALONE, which is the part worth reading. `title` is 205
     * of the family and is length-INDEPENDENT — identical for two characters and
     * for twenty-seven — because `Math.max(0, …)` parks the unit in the title's
     * band on any chart whose plot starts high. That looks exactly like the
     * clamp bug this engine has recorded five times, and flooring it at the
     * title's ink was written, measured, and REFUSED:
     *
     *     clip alone                1,014 pairs, no new shapes
     *     clip + floor at the ink   1,156 pairs, and TWO new families —
     *                               `value-axis-title / category#` at 310
     *
     * The floor takes the title collisions to zero and buys them by moving the
     * unit down into the category names on short charts. The CAGR caption's own
     * note two files over says the same thing about the same move: "a clamp
     * moves a label whether or not the destination is free". A clamp that has a
     * free destination is a fix; this one does not.
     *
     * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is decide where a unit belongs on a crowded chart.
     * The 205 on the title stay, and the rest is the unit against the topmost
     * tick and the totals row — genuinely contested space. The three relocations
     * in `docs/BACKLOG.md` — end of the axis, folded into the top tick, its own

     *
     * WHY DROPPING IS RIGHT HERE, when dropping author text is normally refused.
     * The 22 are all `80x60` and `300x60` at 18pt, and on those charts the
     * engine ALREADY drops the category names, the axis strip and the legend —
     * "Chrome yields to the title" in docs/MANUAL.md, whose worked example is a
     * 300x60 banner. The unit was the one thing in that band still drawn on top
     * of the title. It is not being singled out; it was the exception.
     *
     * On every frame anybody presents at, the unit is untouched: 154 of 176 kept,
     * and 100% at 480x300 and above.
     *
     * THE CONSTANTS HERE ARE NOT LOAD-BEARING, which is worth saying because it
     * looks like they should be. Three mutants survive `value-axis-title.test.ts`
     * and all three are equivalent, not gaps: `* 1.21` moved to `* 1.9` or
     * `* 1.0`, and the `Math.max(0, …)` taken back out of the decision, each
     * leave the drawn/dropped sets identical at 154/22. That follows from the
