/**
 * Reconciliation: deciding what a demo run ACTUALLY produced, after the host
 * has stopped moving.
 *
 * The inline checks in `insertDemoDeck` all fire while the host is still
 * catching up — `waitForLateSync` gives an abandoned sync five seconds, and a
 * real PowerPoint-web run has been observed committing a batch minutes after
 * the 45s timeout that gave up on it. Every readback taken in that window is a
 * snapshot of a host mid-flight, and acting on it produces the exact damage
 * seen in `Presentation_4.pptx`:
 *
 *   - Two identical Line charts (slides 4 and 5) and two identical Gantt charts
 *     (slides 6 and 7). Attempt 1 timed out, its readback showed nothing yet,
 *     so a retry drew the chart again on a NEW slide — and then BOTH attempts'
 *     shapes committed.
 *   - A `NOT COMPLETE` banner sitting on top of a chart that is, in fact,
 *     complete. The stamp was written while the slide still looked empty.
 *   - An Agenda slide with all 13 of its shapes present, reported BLANK.
 *   - One `POWERCHART_CONFIG` tag across five charts, because the grouping sync
 *     ran at the most loaded moment of the run.
 *
 * None of that is fixable with a better timeout, because the host's commit is
 * not bounded by anything we can observe. It IS fixable afterwards: once the
 * run has finished and the host has settled, the deck itself says what
 * happened. Every demo slide carries a `POWERCHART_DEMO_SLOT` tag naming the
 * item it belongs to, so a single settled pass over the added range can pair
 * slides with intent and repair the difference.
 *
 * This module is that decision, kept pure: snapshots in, a plan of actions out.
 * No Office.js, no I/O, no clock — so every rule below is unit-testable at the
 * speed of a function call, which is the only way any of this gets tested at
 * all (the host it exists to survive cannot be run in CI). `applyReconcilePlan`
 * in `src/render/powerpoint.ts` is the thin part that talks to PowerPoint.
