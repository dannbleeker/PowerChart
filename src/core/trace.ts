 * twice, a banner contradicting its own slide, a verification pass that
 * returned nothing and said nothing about why. Each time the missing thing
 * was the same — an ordered record of what the add-in actually did, while it
 * was doing it. `console.log` does not survive a crashed tab, and PowerPoint
 * on the web has crashed the tab.
 *
 * So: an in-memory ring the pane can hand back as JSON alongside the run
 * report. Off by default — the cost of a disabled `trace()` is one boolean
 * test, and nothing is retained — and switched on from the pane when someone
 * is actually chasing something.
 *
 * Deliberately independent of the pane and of Office.js, so the renderer can
 * write to it without importing either. If the UI toggle is dropped before
 * shipping, this module and its call sites stay: `setTracing(true)` from a
 * console is all a future investigation needs.
