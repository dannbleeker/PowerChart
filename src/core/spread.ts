/**
 * Beeswarm-constrained overlap relief: separate circles along ONE axis, leaving

 *
 * Free 2D repulsion is deliberately not offered. In a scatter/bubble BOTH axes
 * encode data and a reader takes a value off each, so moving a marker in 2D
 * corrupts two readings at once with nothing to bound them. Along one named
 * axis there is exactly one approximation, it is capped, and the caller can
 * print the cap — the reader is told the error bar instead of being misled.
 *
 * Deterministic by construction: a fixed pass count, Jacobi updates (every pair
 * is measured against the same state, so the result cannot depend on visit
 * order), array iteration only, and no randomness.
