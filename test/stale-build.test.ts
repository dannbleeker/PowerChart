/**
 * What the pane says when a release lands while it is open.
 *
 * FOUND BY A ROUND. The 4:3 leg of the 2026-08-28 cycle failed every scenario
 * after the first, and the first one's message was the browser's:
 *
 *     Failed to fetch dynamically imported module:
 *     https://ssf-chart.struktureretsundfornuft.dk/assets/pptxgen.es-C8DOodSg.js
 *
 * A build had been published while the pane was open. Vite hashes every chunk,
 * a deploy replaces the whole `assets/` directory, and the pane was holding an
 * `index.html` naming chunks the server no longer had.
 *
 * It is not a harness problem — it is the ordinary shape of a user's day. The
 * pane stays open for a PowerPoint session, releases go out during one, and the
 * next deck insert asks for a file that has been deleted. What that user saw was
 * a URL, from an add-in that looked broken.
