/**
 * HOW MANY SHAPES A CHART IS ALLOWED TO BE, and nothing has ever capped it.
 *
 * Shapes are the unit of cost on PowerPoint on the web, and the archive is
 * unambiguous about the price. An in-place update runs about **767ms per shape**
 * — measured over 178 updates — which makes `updated only the shapes that
 * changed` 11.8 calls and 108 seconds a round, a quarter of a round, with a
 * worst single chart at 26.4s. It is not batchable: within one update the chunks
 * cost 4514, 4366 and 4657ms, flat, so the cost is linear in shapes written and
 * server-side.
 *
 * And past a point it stops being slow and starts being fatal. Round 150
 * recorded **400-500 shapes in one context crashing PowerPoint on all seven
 * attempts**, and before the slab rule took the rise into account a chart in the
 * shipped deck sat at 300.
 *
 * So this is the third ratchet in the house style — `overlap-budget` for the
 * variant sweep, `showcase-overlap` for the shipped deck, and this for density.
 * Same rules: a kind over budget is a regression, an unbudgeted kind is a
 * regression by definition, and a budget left ABOVE the real figure fails, so
 * making a chart lighter forces the number down instead of banking slack.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a claim that any of these figures is too high; it
 * is a claim that they should not RISE without somebody saying so.
 *
 * ── IT COUNTED THE WRONG THING FOR ITS WHOLE LIFE ───────────────────────────
 * Every number above is about SHAPES, and until 2026-08-30 this file measured
 * `scene.nodes.length` — the graph the layouts emit, not what the renderer
 * writes. They are not the same count and `estimateOfficeShapes` exists to say
 * so: a polygon is one node and one line per EDGE, a wedge one node and a whole
 * fan. So the gate was blind in exactly the places density comes from.
 *
 * What it was hiding, measured the day it was fixed:
 *   - The hex tile map: 146 nodes, **401 shapes**. Sitting inside the 400-500
 *     window that took PowerPoint down on all seven attempts in round 150,
 *     while `keeps every shipped chart clear of the count that crashed the
 *     host` passed on 146. That test could not have failed: the number it
 *     compared against 300 was not the number in its own docstring.
 *   - The violin: 16 nodes, **259 shapes**. Budgeted as the second-LIGHTEST
 *     chart we ship when it is now the heaviest — a 16x under-count.
 *   - Sunburst 21 -> 101, pie 17 -> 56, doughnut 15 -> 55, radar 36 -> 79.
 *   - The deck total: 5560 nodes, 7128 shapes.
 *
 * The tile map is 146 shapes now because its tiles became fillable symbols, and
 * the deck 6873. The violin is the one that would repay attention next.
 *
 * A gate is only as true as the quantity it reads, and this one named its
 * quantity correctly in prose while measuring its neighbour in code.
