/**
 * EVERY TEXT OVERLAP THIS ENGINE STILL HAS, counted, named, and capped.
 *
 * `frame-fit.test.ts` sweeps each kind at eight frames and seven fonts and now
 * allows no overlap at all. What it does not sweep is the option and data-shape
 * VARIANTS — a chart with twenty-four categories, ten series, a secondary axis,
 * a pareto, a footnote — and that is the blind spot the whole "24 categories"
 * family lived in for nine days. The gate was green throughout.
 *
 * This is that sweep, ratcheted. It ran for the first time on 2026-08-27 at
 * 2,148 overlapping pairs, measured by the frame gate's own ink rule; a night's
 * work took it to 537. Pinning it per SHAPE rather than as one total matters,
 * because a total can hide a trade — one family fixed while another grows — and
 * a shape absent from the table is a regression by definition, since it is text
 * the engine has never been seen to draw over text before.
 *
 * AND THEN THIS FILE TURNED OUT TO HAVE THE SAME BLIND SPOT IT WAS BUILT TO
 * CLOSE. It swept every option and every data shape and never one of each: the
 * two tables were CONCATENATED, so a secondary axis on ten series, or a
 * footnote on twenty-four categories, was not among the 24,000 charts. Crossing
 * a slice of them on 2026-08-29 took the count from 537 to 4,010 and found
 * twenty-two shapes this engine had never been SEEN to draw — 2,683 of them in
 * small-multiples panels alone. Nothing about the engine changed that day.
 *
 * So: the total moved because the sweep did, and a number from before that date
 * is not comparable with one after it. `CROSS_OPTIONS` below says what is
 * crossed and, more usefully, what still is not.
 *
 * THEN THE 2,683 WENT AWAY IN ONE LINE, the same day. Every `p#-` shape is now
 * zero and the total is 1,327. `buildMultiples` was handing panels a NEGATIVE
 * height and `clampDim` was rewriting it to `DEFAULT_SIZE.height` — so each
 * panel laid out as a full 300-point chart and ten of them stacked 9.6 points
 * apart in a 60-point box. It now declines a grid whose panels have no room.
 * See `buildMultiples` for the proof and docs/BACKLOG.md for the shape of it.
 *
 * That is the sequence this file is for, in one day: a widened sweep made a
 * family visible, the family turned out to be one defect, and the defect was
 * arithmetic rather than layout.
 *
 * THEN 1,327 BECAME 1,014, by clipping the unit label. `valueAxisTitle` is
 * documented as a SHORT unit — "e.g. `€m`" — and the sweep tests it with a
 * twenty-seven-character sentence, so most of the largest family here was the
 * cost of a string the option does not support. Clipping it to a share of the
 * chart keeps the author's text where it fits and truncates where it cannot,
 * which is what this engine already does to gantt and category names.
 *
 * Flooring its `y` at the title's ink was measured in the same hour and
 * REFUSED: it takes `title / value-axis-title` to zero and pays 310 new
 * `value-axis-title / category#` for it, for a worse total of 1,156. A clamp
 * moves a label whether or not the destination is free — which the CAGR
 * caption's own note already said, about the same move.
 *
 * THEN 1,014 BECAME 785: the unit YIELDS to the title instead of moving. Not a
 * clamp, a drop, on the 22 charts of 176 where its ink would land in the title's
 * — all of them 80x60 and 300x60 at 18pt, where the engine already drops the
 * category names, the axis strip and the legend ("Chrome yields to the title",
 * docs/MANUAL.md). The unit was the last thing in that band still printing over
 * the title. 154 of 176 units survive, 100% at 480x300 and above.
 *
 * ================================================================
 * READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING ANY NUMBER IN THIS FILE AT A DECISION.
 * ================================================================
 *
 * **This sweep measures an input the option does not support, and the resulting
 * figure has now driven three decisions, two of them wrongly.**
 *
 * `OPTIONS.valueAxisTitle` is `"Revenue in millions of euro"`. The option is
 * documented as `€m`; the two uses in the 123-chart shipped deck are `€m` and
 * `$m (log)`. Run the identical sweep with `€m` and:
 *
 *     total                    785  ->  206
 *     value-axis-title family  687  ->  118
 *     value-axis-title/legend# 308  ->   12
 *
 * So about two-thirds of the largest family in this file — and a quarter of its
 * headline total — is one test string. What it cost: the floor above was refused
 * on the long string's numbers (1,156, worse) when on `€m` the same change is a
 * net WIN (437 -> 346); and `title / value-axis-title`, 205 pairs, turned out to
 * come entirely from ONE frame, 300x60, rather than from the label's width.
 *
 * The stress string stays — it found the missing clip, which was a real bug, and
 * a gate that only tests kind inputs is not a gate. But the number it produces is
 * a STRESS figure and must be named as one. Do not carry it into a product
 * decision without re-running at the documented input first; the two answer
 * different questions and they have disagreed every time it mattered.
 *
 * Same shape as this file's own founding lesson one level up: a gate is only as
 * wide as its sweep. A gate is also only as true as its inputs.
 *
 * WHEN A NUMBER HERE GOES DOWN, EDIT IT DOWN. The budget is a ceiling, not a
 * target, and one left above the real figure is a ratchet that has stopped
 * ratcheting — the next regression hides under the slack. There is a test below
 * that enforces exactly that, so improving the engine is supposed to fail this
 * file.
 *
 * The sweep is 24 options and 10 data shapes across every kind, eight frames,
 * two fonts and both orientations — about 24,000 charts — and it runs in eight
 * seconds, which is why it can live in the ordinary suite rather than in a
 * script somebody has to remember.

/**
 * THE DECORATIONS, WHICH THIS SWEEP HAS NEVER ONCE VARIED.
 *
 * `overlap-budget`, `shape-budget` and `showcase-overlap` contained ZERO
 * references to `decorations` between them. The sweep varied chart kind, frame,
 * font size, orientation and a cross-product of options — and never the segment
 * labels, series labels, column totals, grand total, category axis, value axis
 * or the `100% =` note.
 *
 * Those are precisely the nodes that collide. Every text-over-text defect this
 * project has fixed was a label against another label, so the budget that guards
 * text-over-text was measured on charts drawn with most of their text turned
 * OFF. `sampleConfig` gives each kind a small default set — `clustered` gets
 * `categoryAxis`, `stacked` gets `seriesLabels` — and a user who ticks three
 * more boxes in the pane produces a chart this sweep had never drawn.
 *
 * MERGED, NOT REPLACED, and that is the whole reason these are not in `OPTIONS`
 * beside everything else. `OPTIONS` is applied with a shallow spread, so a
 * `decorations` key there would REPLACE each kind's defaults and quietly narrow
 * the sweep while appearing to widen it. These merge on top, which is also what
 * the pane does when a user ticks a box.
 *
 * ── AND THE ANSWER, WHICH IS THAT THE ENGINE IS FINE HERE ──
 *
 * Recorded because a negative result nobody writes down gets re-investigated.
 * At the frames these run at, turning EVERY decoration on adds no text overlap
 * the budget did not already carry: the total stayed at 785. The variants are
 * not idle — each builds 100 charts with zero refusals and adds real text, up to
 * +232 nodes for `everything labelled` — they simply collide with nothing.
 *
 * Nor is there a shape-budget risk, which is the other thing more labels could
 * have cost: across 25 kinds at a full-slide frame, full decoration is +18
 * shapes at worst and the heaviest decorated chart is `area` at 195, against the
 * ~300 where this host starts dying. Zero kinds cross it.
 *
 * So the blind spot was real and what it was hiding was nothing. That is worth
 * one paragraph and no further work.

/**
 * What each remaining shape is allowed, as of 2026-08-29. Total 1,327.
 *
 * **NONE OF THESE THREE NUMBERS MEANS ANYTHING WITHOUT ITS SWEEP.** 537 was the
 * uncrossed sweep; 4,010 was the same engine measured by the crossed one; 1,327
 * is the crossed sweep after `buildMultiples` stopped building grids whose
 * panels have no height. Only the last step was a change to the engine. Never
 * compare a figure here with one from before 2026-08-29 without saying which
 * sweep produced it — the 2026-08-19 "75 pairs" was mis-compared exactly that
 * way once already.
 *
 * A `#` stands in for any run of digits, so `label-3 / label-4` and `label-9 /
 * label-10` are one shape. What each family is, and why the ones left are still
 * here, is in `docs/BACKLOG.md`.
 *
 * The 1,327 is one family and a tail:
 *
 *     1,208   `value-axis-title` — the owner's open decision
 *       119   everything else
 *
 * THOSE ARE NOT 1,058 AND 269, which is what the 4,010 sweep split into and
 * what this said until it was re-summed. Removing the broken grids did not just
 * subtract 2,683: a chart that used to render as an impossible grid now renders
 * as an ordinary chart, and an ordinary chart with a unit label contributes
 * `value-axis-title` overlaps. The family GREW by about 150 as the tail shrank
 * by the same. A subtraction is not a re-measurement.
 *
 * The `p#-*` family that appeared here at 2,683 is GONE, and its story is worth
 * the four lines. It was not a labelling defect — that was the first guess and
 * a diagnostic refuted it; the category axis thins correctly and not one of the
 * 910 `p#-category#` pairs was two names in the same panel. It was arithmetic:
 * ten series in two columns is five rows, `panelH` came out at −0.4, and
 * `clampDim` rewrote that to `DEFAULT_SIZE.height` because it treats `<= 0` as
 * a malformed config. Ten full 300-point charts, stacked 9.6 points apart, in a
 * box 60 points tall. `buildMultiples` declines such a grid now.
 *
 * ALL TWENTY-THREE went, including `p#-total# / p#-cagr-label`, which a probe
 * had singled out as "not the grid" — the only family with a within-panel count
 * and the only one at ordinary sizes. The probe and this table were not
 * measuring the same charts: it built its `10 series` shape from scratch where
 * `DATA_SHAPES` spreads the sample's own series and keeps their colours and
 * roles. A diagnostic written beside a gate has to reuse the gate's variant
 * table, or its numbers answer a different question — and agreeing everywhere
 * else is what made that one look trustworthy.
