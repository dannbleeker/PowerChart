/**
 * A chart is a box on a slide, and nothing it draws may leave that box.
 *
 * Neither PowerPoint renderer wraps or clips a text box, so a label wider than
 * its frame is not truncated — it is drawn across whatever the chart happens to
 * be sitting next to. The same is true of a plot: a bar hanging below the frame
 * lands on the slide, not on the chart.
 *
 * The sweep is the point of this file. Every earlier fix in this area was found
 * by looking at one chart at one size, and each time the same defect was sitting
 * in four other layouts — the title alone overflowed 13 of 17 kinds. So the
 * property is asserted over the whole product of kinds and frame sizes, and the
 * unit tests below it name the mechanisms that sweep would otherwise only

 *   - a quadrant label took `Math.max(20, zone - 8)` — a floor that RAISES a
 *     width, the scatter legend's own bug in another layout;
 *   - a band's label was priced in font sizes with nothing bounding it;
 *   - a lollipop's value label never got the row-pitch bound the rest of the
 *     horizontal labels were given.

 * by nothing — the same hole the decorations were in, one level up. Seven more
 * defect families, and the two largest are not small-frame corners:
 *
 *   - the SEMI-doughnut gauge drew its labels through a clamp that cannot place
 *     a box wider than the frame, its leader lines past the arc's own edge, and
 *     its headline total below the chart;
 *   - an EXPLODED slice moves `r * 0.08` along its midline and takes its outside
 *     label with it, past a band sized for the un-exploded ring — 9.6pt below a
 *     960x540 doughnut;
 *   - `axisBreak`'s zigzag overhangs the plot by a fixed 4 points, which is more
 *     than the plot's own inset on a small chart;
 *   - `pareto`'s secondary axis labels are centred on their ticks with nothing
 *     stopping the topmost one leaving the chart;
 *   - `multiples` divides the frame into one chart per series, so a titled
 *     300x60 chart asks for a 150x25 panel — a size no sweep here had ever
 *     asked for, whose own TITLE then overflowed, and at three panels a 7.6pt
 *     one whose category axis was drawn 21.6pt below the chart;
 *   - a `footnote` or an explicit `scale` squeezes the plot until a line's or a
 *     combo's markers, drawn AROUND their points, cross the frame's edge.
 *
 * The wedge measurement had to be fixed before any of this could be read: see

/**
 * A DECORATION can put a chart outside its frame, and until now nothing swept

 * whichever ones that sample happens to carry.
 *
 * Turning each boolean decoration on over 25 kinds x 6 frames x 4 fonts — 16,200
 * configs — found 90 combinations drawing outside the chart. Two shapes account
 * for most of them, and both are the same defect: a band reserved whether or not
 * it can be paid for, and whether or not anything is drawn in it.
 *
 * - `variance` reserves a flat `fontSize * 4.5` for the IBCS tier — 81pt of a
 *   60pt-tall chart at 18pt — and the category axis is placed BELOW the plot
 *   plus that band, so the category names were drawn off the foot of the chart:
 *   8.1pt past a 300x60 frame at the DEFAULT font, 85pt past a 120x90 one at
 *   32pt.
 * - `hundredPercentNote` reserves the footnote row from the FLAG, while the note
 *   itself is only written when `hundredPercentTotal` has an answer — a pie, a
 *   doughnut, or a 100% chart with one denominator. On every other kind the row
 *   was taken for a line that was never drawn, `fitPlot` floored the plot and
 *   grew it back up through the totals band, and the labels in that band ended
 *   above the top of the chart.
 *
 * This gate is the sweep itself, narrowed to the two shapes that are fixed. The
 * rest are listed in the PR that added it.
