/**
 * WHAT AN IN-PLACE WRITE ACTUALLY SENDS, counted.
 *
 * `applyNodeInPlace` wrote every property of every changed node
 * unconditionally. The host's own statement list puts one text node at roughly
 * twenty statements, so a retitle — the single edit the fast path exists for —
 * sent twenty to change one string, and `same scale across the deck` sent some
 * three hundred and sixty to move eighteen nodes.
 *
 * `planSceneUpdate` now says which property groups differ and the applier
 * writes only those. **Nothing else in the suite can see that.** Correctness
 * tests cannot: writing MORE than necessary is still correct, just slow, so a
 * mutant that ignores `parts` and writes everything leaves every other test
 * green. That mutant is exactly the regression this file exists to catch — the
 * optimisation being quietly reverted.
 *
 * So this counts. The shape is a recording proxy rather than the office-host
 * fake, because the fake stores values and cannot tell "wrote the same number"
 * from "did not write".
 */

/**
 * The enums only, and they matter more than they look.
 *
 * Six of the applier's writes sit inside `try` blocks that read
 * `PowerPoint.TextVerticalAlignment` and friends. With no such global the enum
 * READ throws, the catch swallows it, and those six writes never happen — so
 * the first version of this file counted thirteen writes for a whole text node
 * and silently tested a path with the margins and alignment missing.
 *
 * With the enums present it counts twenty, which is the figure `powerpoint.ts`
 * quotes from the host's own statement list. That agreement is the check that
 * this file is counting the right thing.
