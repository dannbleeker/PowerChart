## Special series-name conventions (the "datasheet rows")

| Row name | Effect |
|---|---|
| `100%=` | per-category denominator for `stacked100` (columns can stay short of 100%) |
| `X extent` | Mekko-with-units: explicit column widths |
| `X`, `Y`, `Size`, `Group` | scatter/bubble coordinates, bubble area, point coloring (1..k) |
| `Color` | scatter/bubble: numeric third variable on a sequential color ramp (with a gradient legend); supersedes `Group` coloring |
| `X line`, `Y line` | scatter partition lines at those values |
| `Trend` | any value present → OLS trend line, labelled with its R² and p-value |
| `Start`, `End`, `Milestone` | Gantt bars & milestone markers (numbers or day values) |
| `% Complete` | Gantt: darker progress fill inside the bar (0-100 or 0-1) |
| `Baseline start`, `Baseline end` | Gantt: thin ghost bars showing the original plan vs actual |
| `After` | Gantt dependency: 1-based predecessor index → elbow arrow |
| `Today` | Gantt today line at the (single) value |
| `Holiday` | Gantt: shade these dates |
| `Bracket <label>` | Gantt: interval annotation spanning min→max of the row's values |
| `Column <label>` | Gantt: numeric table column beside the task labels (right-aligned, own precision; unit goes in the label) |

`gantt: { workdays?: boolean | number[] }` — working-day timeline: non-working
days collapse to zero width so a bar's length reads as working days, not
elapsed days (Mon→Mon = 5 units, not 7). `true` = Mon–Fri; an array of ISO
weekday numbers (1=Mon … 7=Sun) sets a custom week, e.g. `[7,1,2,3,4]` for
Sun–Thu. `Holiday` rows drop out of the scale too, and weekend/holiday shading
switches off with it. Calendar timelines only; a no-op on a numeric one.

| `Error`, `Error+`, `Error-` | error bars at the column total / line point (± or asymmetric); stacked/clustered/line/area, vertical |
| `Target` | bullet tick across each column; on waterfalls also a hatched gap-to-target segment + label |
| `Band low`, `Band high` | line charts: shaded confidence/uncertainty ribbon (rows never draw as lines) |
| `Min`, `Q1`, `Median`, `Q3`, `Max` | boxplot five-number summary (whiskers to Min/Max, think-cell style); suffix "\| group" ("Min \| 2024") for side-by-side grouped boxes |
| `Mean` | boxplot mean marker (×) |
| `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close` | candlestick OHLC prices per period (category) |
| `Outlier <n>` | boxplot: extra outlier dots in precomputed mode |

Gantt category conventions: `"Activity | Owner | Remark"` adds responsible and
remark columns; a leading `">"` indents; a category with no Start/End/Milestone
renders as a bold section-header band.

**Dates**: for Gantt rows, pass days-since-epoch numbers and set `data.dates:
true` (compute as `Math.round(Date.parse("2026-01-15")/86400000)`), or let the
interactive datasheet parse ISO strings. Calendar timelines pick weeks (with
weekend shading), months, or quarters by span automatically.

**Waterfall semantics**: values are deltas; `waterfall.totalIndices` lists
categories drawn from the baseline to the running total (think-cell's `e`).
Multiple series → stacked waterfall (contributions stack per column).

**Clustered-stacked**: give series `stack: 0`, `stack: 1`, … — same index
stacks together; different indices sit side by side per category.

**Boxplot without summary rows**: when no `Min`/`Q1`/… rows are present,
every series row is a raw observation — quartiles are computed (exclusive
method) and whiskers use Tukey 1.5×IQR fences with outliers drawn as dots.

**Funnel**: one series of stage values (order ascending for a pyramid);
centered bands with width ∝ value, conversion % vs the previous stage in
the gaps, stage names on the left.

**Waffle**: a 10×10 unit grid (1 cell = 1%), filling from the bottom-left.
Categories are the parts (pie semantics, first series); shares round to
whole cells by largest remainder and unassigned cells stay gray. The
denominator is the `100%=` row when present, else the value sum — except a
single category ≤ 100 with no denominator, which reads as a literal
percentage (`68` → 68 cells + a big "68%" beside the grid).

**Stepped line/area** (`decorations.stepped`): draw values as a staircase
instead of sloped segments — `"after"` holds each value then jumps at the
next category (HV), `"before"` jumps immediately (VH), `"center"` steps at
the midpoint (HVH). Works for `line` and `area`; area fills follow the steps.

**Area with negative values**: `area` charts stack positives above the zero
baseline and negatives below it, so a series that goes negative (e.g. net
income over time) dips under the axis instead of being clamped to 0.

**Scatter/bubble trajectory** (`decorations.trajectory`): connects the points
in datasheet (row) order with a trail and a direction arrowhead at each
segment midpoint — a Gapminder-style path of one entity through the X/Y
space over time. Order the categories chronologically.

**Scatter/bubble continuous color** (a `Color` row): maps each point's numeric
value onto a sequential color ramp and swaps the group chip legend for a
gradient legend with min/max labels. Encodes a third variable (or a fourth,
on bubbles alongside `Size`). Supersedes `Group` coloring when both exist.

**Smoothed lines** (`decorations.smooth`): draws smooth Catmull-Rom curves
through the points instead of straight segments (sampled to a dense polyline
since the renderers have no freeform paths). Ignored when `stepped` is set.

**Waterfall spacers** (`waterfall.spacerIndices`): blank categories that draw
no bar and leave a gap, grouping a long bridge into sections. The running
total carries across and the dashed connector bridges the gap — give the
spacer category an empty name so no axis label shows.

**Boxplot jitter** (`boxplot.jitter`): in raw-sample mode, overlays every
observation as a deterministically jittered dot over its box, so the reader
sees the distribution and sample size behind the summary (outlier dots are
subsumed by the jittered points).

**Boxplot notch** (`boxplot.notch`): in raw-sample mode, pinches each box at
the median ± 1.57·IQR/√n confidence interval — boxes whose notches don't
overlap have significantly different medians. Precomputed boxes (no sample
size) stay rectangular.

**Mean±SD box** (`boxplot.meanSd`): in raw-sample mode, draws each box as
mean ± 1 standard deviation with the centre line at the mean and whiskers to
mean ± 2·SD — the scientific "mean and spread" summary rather than the
quartile/order-statistic one. No mean × marker (the centre line is the mean);
mutually exclusive with `notch`.

**Gantt summary bars** (`decorations.summaryBars`): draws a capped summary bar
on each section-header row (a category with no Start/End/Milestone), spanning
min(start)→max(end) of the activities beneath it up to the next header.

**Gantt critical path** (`decorations.criticalPath`): over the `After`
dependency edges, finds the chain with the greatest cumulative duration (the
critical path) and highlights its bars with a red outline and its dependency
arrows in thicker red — the MS-Project convention for "the tasks that decide
the finish date". No-op without `After` rows.

**Sparklines** (`decorations.sparkline`, line/area): a compact, axis-less,
word-sized trend line with no chrome — a thin line, an optional leading label
(the title / series name), a trailing value, and dots on the min (red), max
(green) and last points. Pair with `multiples: {}` for a table of sparklines,
one row per series (KPI dashboards).

**Radar min–max band** (`decorations.radarBand`): shades the per-spoke min–max
envelope of the peer series (all series except the last) as a band and draws
the last series prominently on top — the "peer range + us" competitive
profile. The legend collapses the peers into one "Peer range" swatch.

**Other bucket** (`otherBucket.max`): for stacked/clustered/100% charts with
many series, keep the `max` largest (by absolute total) and sum the rest into
one trailing "Other" segment — think-cell's "Move to Other Series". No-op when
there are already `max` or fewer series.

**Calendar heatmap** (`heatmap.calendar`): a single daily series with date
categories (ISO strings or day numbers with `data.dates`) is laid out as a
weekday (row) × week (column) grid with month labels — the
GitHub-contributions view. Falls back to the matrix layout without dates.

**Butterfly stacked flanks** (`butterfly.split`): the first `split` series
stack on the left flank and the rest stack on the right (a legend replaces the
two headers). Omit for the classic two-series butterfly (series 0 vs series 1).

**Radar per-spoke scales** (`radar.perSpoke`): normalise each spoke to its own
maximum so spokes carrying different KPI units become comparable in shape; the
shared numeric ticks give way to fraction rings (25/50/75/100 %).

**Radial bar chart / coxcomb** (`radar.bars`): instead of connecting the spokes
into a polygon, draw each category as an equal-angle wedge whose radius encodes
its value (a Nightingale rose), from a small inner hole with concentric value
rings. A single series colours bars by category; multiple series stack outward
within each sector.

**Stacked radar** (`radar.stacked`): series stack cumulatively along each spoke
(part-to-whole across dimensions) — nested filled bands instead of overlaid
polygons; the scale reaches the per-spoke sums.

**Variable-radius pie** (`pie.variableRadius`, or add a `Radius` datasheet row):
each slice's angle still encodes the first series while its radius encodes a
second metric — a two-variable pie. Labels sit outside; pie only (no doughnut,
no breakout).

**Heatmap cell-size encoding** (`heatmap.sizeEncode`): each cell shrinks to a
centred square whose area encodes the value's magnitude (colour still encodes
the signed value) — near-zero cells fade to dots, strong cells fill their slot.
The corrplot view for correlation / signed matrices.

**Heatmap row clustering** (`heatmap.cluster`): reorder the rows by
average-linkage similarity (Euclidean over each row's values) so similar rows
sit together, and draw a dendrogram in a left gutter. Needs ≥3 rows.

**Combo stacked-area base** (`combo.columns: "area"`): the base under the line
series is a stacked area instead of columns — trend-of-mix plus a KPI line
(pair with `secondaryAxis` for a %-on-the-right line).

**Missing-data bridge** (`decorations.bridgeGaps`): line charts connect
straight across null categories instead of breaking into separate segments
(applies to plain straight lines, not `smooth`/`stepped`).

**Floating segments**: give a stacked-column series `color: "transparent"` and
it occupies the stack without drawing — the segments above it "float" clear of
the baseline (a lightweight floating-bar / range effect).

**Combo base modes** (`combo.columns`): the column base under the lines can be
`waterfall` (a bridge with a %-of-total line over it — set `waterfall.totalIndices`)
or `mekko` (variable-width columns with an overlaid line) as well as the
stacked / clustered / 100% modes. The lines use a secondary axis (forced for
mekko / 100%, which have no shared value axis).

**Combo independent line axes** (`combo.lineAxes: "independent"`): each line
series is zoomed to its own value range and labelled at every point, so several
KPIs in unlike units read on one chart without a shared secondary axis.

**Tilemap hex tiles** (`tilemap.shape: "hex"`): draws the cartogram with
hexagonal tiles (odd rows offset, nested rows) instead of squares — filled in
SVG/pptx, outlines in the live add-in (polygons have no freeform fill there).

**Tilemap mini-glyphs** (`tilemap.glyph: "bars"`): with a multi-series
datasheet (categories = regions, series = periods), each tile draws a mini bar
chart of that region's values with a series legend, instead of a single value
color.

**100% charts with negatives**: `stacked100` no longer clamps negatives — a
negative segment renders below the zero line as its share of the (positive)
column total, so returns / adjustments stay visible.

**Semi-circle gauge** (`kind: "doughnut"` + `pie.semi: true`): a half-doughnut
scorecard — categories fill a 180° arc across the top with the total in the
open centre.

**Pareto** (`pareto: true` on a clustered/combo chart): sorts the categories by
the (first non-line) series descending and overlays a computed "Cumulative %"
line on a secondary axis — the 80/20 view. Rewrites the chart into a combo.

**Bump chart** (`kind: "line"` + `decorations.bump: true`): values are ranks
(1 = best) drawn on an inverted integer axis (rank 1 at the top) with thick
lines, round markers and a "Name" label at both ends — rank-over-time.

**Horizontal profile chart** (`kind: "line" | "area"` + `horizontal: true`):
rotates the line/area 90° — categories run down the left axis and values
extend to the right. Stacked areas stack outward to the right.

**Sunburst** (`kind: "sunburst"`): a two-ring hierarchical pie — categories
named `"Group | Item"` put groups on the inner ring and their items on the
outer ring; without `"|"` it degrades to a single-ring doughnut.

**Violin** (`kind: "violin"`): a mirrored kernel-density shape per category
from raw samples (every datasheet row is an observation, like the boxplot's
raw mode) with a median tick. The body is a filled polygon — solid in
SVG/pptx, outline-only in the live add-in.

**Candlestick** (`kind: "candlestick"`): OHLC financial bars from rows named
`Open` / `High` / `Low` / `Close`; a high–low wick carries a body from open to
close, green when the period rose and red when it fell.

**Gap width & overlap** (`gapWidth`, `overlap`): mirror Excel's two spacing
controls for the column family. `gapWidth` (0–500, default 50) is the gap
between columns as a percentage of column width — 0 makes them touch
(histogram look), higher makes them thinner. `overlap` (−100…100, default 0)
sets how much clustered bars within a category overlap: positive overlaps
them, negative opens a gap.

**Slope chart**: `kind: "line"` + `decorations.slope: true` with (ideally)
two categories — the before/after comparison. No value axis; vertical
rails carry the two periods and every series gets a colored "Name value"
label at both ends (labels de-overlap automatically).

**Bar-of-pie** (`pie.breakout`): the listed category indices collapse into
one muted "Other" slice (rotated to face 3 o'clock) and are detailed in a
stacked bar on the right with dashed connectors; detail labels show the
share of the grand total.

**Small multiples** (`multiples`): a multi-series chart becomes a grid of
single-series panels titled by series name, pinned to one shared value
scale so panels compare honestly. Special rows (Error, Target, Band
low/high) are carried into every panel. `columns` overrides the grid
(default: one row up to 3 panels, else a near-square).

**Cascade** (decomposition): each stage's bar is a subset of the previous
one, top-aligned on one volume scale; the complement hangs as a muted
labeled box at each split. Category syntax: `"Stage | Drop label | Group
header"` — part 2 captions the remainder of the split into this stage,
consecutive stages sharing part 3 get one spanning header band.
series[0] = kept counts per stage.

**Radar**: categories = spokes (first at 12 o'clock, clockwise), series =
translucent polygons; keep 5–10 spokes and ≤3 series. **Heatmap**: series =
rows, categories = columns; one global color scale (diverging through white
when the data spans zero). **Tilemap**: categories = region codes (US postal,
ISO-2 for eu/europe, or NA/LATAM/EU/MEA/SSA/CIS/SA/EA/SEA/OCE for world) —
the layout is auto-detected from the codes or pinned with `map:`.

## Chart-design formalia (baked-in defaults, per "the good chart" practice)

Every chart should carry: a message title, a `footnote` citing source and
period, sorted categories where order is free, labels on the data instead of
a value axis, and — on percentage charts — `hundredPercentNote` so readers
know what 100% is. Use `decorations.connectors` on stacked charts to make
segment development followable, `series.colors` to draw the eye to one data
point, `callouts` to comment on it, and `bands` to mark a reference region.

## Palette

Default 8-slot categorical palette (CVD-validated): `#2a78d6 #1baf7a #eda100
#008300 #4a3aa7 #e34948 #e87ba4 #eb6834`. Waterfall decreases use `#e34948`,
totals `#898781`. Override via `style.palette` or per-series `color`.

## Output

`scripts/render-pptx.mjs` emits one 13.33×7.5in slide per config with the chart
centered, every bar/label/line as a native PowerPoint shape, and exact
adjustable pie geometry. `scripts/render-svg.mjs` emits SVGs for fast visual QA.
